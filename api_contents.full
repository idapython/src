    # 0: emit(code: mcode_t, width: int, l: int, r: int, d: int, offsize: int) -> minsn_t *
    
    Emit one microinstruction. The L, R, D arguments usually mean the register number. However, they depend on CODE. For example:
    * for m_goto and m_jcnd L is the target address
    * for m_ldc L is the constant value to load
    
    
    
    @returns created microinstruction. can be nullptr if the instruction got immediately optimized away.
    
    # 1: emit(code: mcode_t, l: const mop_t *, r: const mop_t *, d: const mop_t *) -> minsn_t *
    
    Emit one microinstruction. This variant accepts pointers to operands. It is more difficult to use but permits to create virtually any instruction. Operands may be nullptr when it makes sense.

    @param flags: reserved for future use
    @returns register containing the operand.

ida_hexrays.codegen_t.microgen_completed(self) -> None
    This method is called when the microcode generation is done.

ida_hexrays.codegen_t.prepare_gen_micro(self) -> "merror_t"
    Setup internal data to handle new instruction. This method should be called before calling gen_micro(). Usually gen_micro() is called by the decompiler. You have to call this function explicitly only if you yourself call gen_micro(). The instruction is in INSN 
            
    @returns MERR_OK - all ok other error codes are fatal

ida_hexrays.codegen_t.store_operand(self, n: int, mop: "mop_t", flags: int = 0, outins: "minsn_t **" = None) -> bool
    Generate microcode to store an operand. In case of success an arbitrary number of instructions can be generated (and even no instruction if the source and target are the same) 
            
    @param n: - number of target INSN operand
    @param mop: - operand to be stored
    @param flags: - reserved for future use
    @param outins: - (OUT) the last generated instruction
    @returns success

ida_hexrays.convert_to_user_call(udc: "udcall_t", cdg: "codegen_t") -> "merror_t"
    try to generate user-defined call for an instruction 
            
    @returns Microcode error codes code: MERR_OK - user-defined call generated else - error (MERR_INSN == inacceptable udc.tif)

ida_hexrays.lvar_ref_t.mba
    Pointer to the parent mba_t object. Since we need to access the 'mba->vars' array in order to retrieve the referenced variable, we keep a pointer to mba_t here. Note: this means this class and consequently mop_t, minsn_t, mblock_t are specific to a mba_t object and cannot migrate between them. fortunately this is not something we need to do. second, lvar_ref_t's appear only after MMAT_LVARS.

ida_hexrays.mba_t.alloc_fict_ea(self, real_ea: ida_idaapi.ea_t) -> ida_idaapi.ea_t
    Allocate a fictional address. This function can be used to allocate a new unique address for a new instruction, if re-using any existing address leads to conflicts. For example, if the last instruction of the function modifies R0 and falls through to the next function, it will be a tail call: LDM R0!, {R4,R7} end of the function start of another function In this case R0 generates two different lvars at the same address:
    * one modified by LDM
    * another that represents the return value from the tail call
    
    
    Another example: a third-party plugin makes a copy of an instruction. This may lead to the generation of two variables at the same address. Example 3: fictional addresses can be used for new instructions created while modifying the microcode. This function can be used to allocate a new unique address for a new instruction or a variable. The fictional address is selected from an unallocated address range. 
            
    @param real_ea: real instruction address (BADADDR is ok too)
    @returns a unique fictional address

    @param size: size of the register in bytes
    @param check_size: if true, only the sizes that correspond to a size of a basic type will be accepted.
    @returns allocated register. mr_none means failure.

ida_hexrays.mba_t.alloc_lvars(self) -> None
    Allocate local variables. Must be called only immediately after optimize_global(), with no modifications to the microcode. Converts registers, stack variables, and similar operands into mop_l.

ida_hexrays.scif_t.mba
    Pointer to the parent mba_t object. Some operations may convert a scattered operand into something simpler, (a stack operand, for example). We will need to create stkvar_ref_t at that moment, this is why we need this pointer. See notes for lvar_ref_t::mba. 
            

ida_hexrays.scif_t.name
    Usually scattered operands are created from a function prototype, which has the name information. We preserve it and use it to name the corresponding local variable. 
            

ida_hexrays.scif_t.type
    Scattered operands always have type info assigned to them because without it we won't be able to manipulte them.

ida_auto
    Functions that work with the autoanalyzer queue.
    
    The autoanalyzer works when IDA is not busy processing the user keystrokes. It has several queues, each queue having its own priority. The analyzer stops when all queues are empty.
    A queue contains addresses or address ranges. The addresses are kept sorted by their values. The analyzer will process all addresses from the first queue, then switch to the second queue and so on. There are no limitations on the size of the queues.
    This file also contains functions that deal with the IDA status indicator and the autoanalysis indicator. You may use these functions to change the indicator value.

ida_bytes
    Contains functions that deal with individual byte characteristics.
    
    Each byte of the disassembled program is represented by a 32-bit value. We will call this value 'flags'. The structure of the flags is here.
    You are not allowed to inspect individual bits of flags and modify them directly. Use special functions to inspect and/or modify flags.
    Flags are kept in a virtual array file (*.id1). Addresses (ea) are all 32-bit (or 64-bit) quantities.

ida_bytes.bin_search(*args)
    Search for a set of bytes in the program
    
    This function has the following signatures:
    
        1. bin_search(start_ea: ida_idaapi.ea_t, end_ea: ida_idaapi.ea_t, data: compiled_binpat_vec_t, flags: int) -> Tuple[ida_idaapi.ea_t, int]

        1. a tuple `(matched-address, index-in-compiled_binpat_vec_t)` (1st form)
        2. the address of a match, or ida_idaapi.BADADDR if not found (2nd form)
    
    This is a low-level function; more user-friendly alternatives
    are available. Please see 'find_bytes' and 'find_string'.

    The 'formats' is a list of tuples. If a tuple has one element then it is the format to be registered with dtid=0
    If the tuple has more than one element, then tuple[0] is the data type and tuple[1:] are the data formats. For example:
    many_formats = [
      (pascal_data_type(), pascal_data_format()),
      (simplevm_data_type(), simplevm_data_format()),
      (makedword_data_format(),),
      (simplevm_data_format(),)
    ]
    The first two tuples describe data types and their associated formats.
    The last two tuples describe two data formats to be used with built-in data types.
    The data format may be attached to several data types. The id of the
    data format is stored in the first data_format_t object. For example:
    assert many_formats[1][1] != -1
    assert many_formats[2][0] != -1
    assert many_formats[3][0] == -1

ida_dirtree
    Types involved in grouping of item into folders.
    
    The dirtree_t class is used to organize a directory tree on top of any collection that allows for accessing its elements by an id (inode).
    No requirements are imposed on the inodes apart from the forbidden value -1 (used to denote a bad inode).
    The dirspec_t class is used to specialize the dirtree. It can be used to introduce a directory structure for:
    * local types
    * structs
    * enums
    * functions
    * names
    * etc

ida_dirtree.DTE_ALREADY_EXISTS

ida_dirtree.DTE_NOT_DIRECTORY
    item is not a directory

ida_dirtree.DTE_NOT_EMPTY
    directory is not empty

ida_dirtree.DTE_NOT_FOUND
    item not found

ida_dirtree.DTE_OK
    ok

ida_dirtree.DTE_OWN_CHILD
    moving inside subdirectory of itself

ida_dirtree.DTN_DISPLAY_NAME
    use short, displayable form of the entry name. for example, 'std::string' instead of 'std::basic_string<char, ...>'. Note that more than one "full name" can have the same displayable name. 
              

ida_dirtree.DTN_FULL_NAME
    use long form of the entry name. That name is unique.

    Get the operand value. This function get fixup bytes from data or an instruction at `ea` and convert them to the operand value (maybe partially). It is opposite in meaning to the `patch_fixup_value()`. For example, FIXUP_HI8 read a byte at `ea` and shifts it left by 8 bits, or AArch64's custom fixup BRANCH26 get low 26 bits of the insn at `ea` and shifts it left by 2 bits. This function is mainly used to get a relocation addend.

    Is fixup processed by processor module?

ida_fixup.patch_fixup_value(ea: ida_idaapi.ea_t, fd: "fixup_data_t") -> bool
    Patch the fixup bytes. This function updates data or an instruction at `ea` to the fixup bytes. For example, FIXUP_HI8 updates a byte at `ea` to the high byte of `fd->off`, or AArch64's custom fixup BRANCH26 updates low 26 bits of the insn at `ea` to the value of `fd->off` shifted right by 2. 
            
    @param ea: address where data are changed, the size of the changed data depends on the fixup type.
    @param fd: fixup data
    @retval false: the fixup bytes do not fit (e.g. `fd->off` is greater than 0xFFFFFFC for BRANCH26). The database is changed even in this case.

ida_fixup.set_fixup(source: ida_idaapi.ea_t, fd: "fixup_data_t") -> None
    Set fixup information. You should fill fixup_data_t and call this function and the kernel will remember information in the database. 
            
    @param source: the fixup source address, i.e. the address modified by the fixup
    @param fd: fixup data

ida_fpro
    System independent counterparts of FILE* related functions from Clib.
    
    You should not use C standard I/O functions in your modules. The reason: Each module compiled with Borland (and statically linked to Borland's library) will host a copy of the FILE * information.
    So, if you open a file in the plugin and pass the handle to the kernel, the kernel will not be able to use it.
    If you really need to use the standard functions, define USE_STANDARD_FILE_FUNCTIONS. In this case do not mix them with q... functions.

ida_funcs
    Routines for working with functions within the disassembled program.
    
    This file also contains routines for working with library signatures (e.g. FLIRT).
    Each function consists of function chunks. At least one function chunk must be present in the function definition - the function entry chunk. Other chunks are called function tails. There may be several of them for a function.
    A function tail is a continuous range of addresses. It can be used in the definition of one or more functions. One function using the tail is singled out and called the tail owner. This function is considered as 'possessing' the tail. get_func() on a tail address will return the function possessing the tail. You can enumerate the functions using the tail by using func_parent_iterator_t.
    Each function chunk in the disassembly is represented as an "range" (a range of addresses, see range.hpp for details) with characteristics.
    A function entry must start with an instruction (code) byte. 
        

ida_funcs.FIND_FUNC_DEFINE

    A graph needs refreshing when it's "backing data". E.g., if the number (or contents) of the objects in the above example, change.
    Let's say the user's plugin ends up finding a 5th piece of scattered data. It should then add it to its internal list of known objects, and tell IDA that the graph needs to be refreshed, using refresh_viewer(). This will cause IDA to:
    * discard all its internal rendering information,
    * call interactive_graph_t::refresh() on the graph so that the user's plugin has a chance to "sync" the number of nodes & edges that this graph contains, to the information that the plugin has collected so far
    * re-create internal rendering information, and
    * repaint the view

    The ::inf structure is saved in the database and contains information specific to the current program being disassembled. Initially it is filled with values from ida.cfg.
    Although it is not a good idea to change values in ::inf structure (because you will overwrite values taken from ida.cfg), you are allowed to do it if you feel it necessary.

ida_idaapi.replfun(func)

ida_idaapi.require(modulename, package = None)
    Load, or reload a module.
    
    When under heavy development, a user's tool might consist of multiple
    modules. If those are imported using the standard 'import' mechanism,
    there is no guarantee that the Python implementation will re-read
    and re-evaluate the module's Python code. In fact, it usually doesn't.
    What should be done instead is 'reload()'-ing that module.
    
    This is a simple helper function that will do just that: In case the
    module doesn't exist, it 'import's it, and if it does exist,
    'reload()'s it.
    
    The importing module (i.e., the module calling require()) will have
    the loaded module bound to its globals(), under the name 'modulename'.
    (If require() is called from the command line, the importing module
    will be '__main__'.)
    
    For more information, see: <http://www.hexblog.com/?p=749>.

ida_idaapi.set_script_timeout(timeout)
    Changes the script timeout value. The script wait box dialog will be hidden and shown again when the timeout elapses.
    See also L{disable_script_timeout}.
    
    @param timeout: This value is in seconds.
                    If this value is set to zero then the script will never timeout.
    @return: Returns the old timeout value

ida_idaapi.struct_unpack(buffer, signed = False, offs = 0)
    Unpack a buffer given its length and offset using struct.unpack_from().
    This function will know how to unpack the given buffer by using the lookup table '__struct_unpack_table'
    If the buffer is of unknown length then None is returned. Otherwise the unpacked value is returned.

    Display "Connection string" instead of "Hostname" and hide the "Port" field.

ida_idd.DBG_FLAG_DEBTHREAD
    Supports creation of a separate thread in ida for the debugger (the debthread). Most debugger functions will be called from debthread (exceptions are marked below) The debugger module may directly call only THREAD_SAFE functions.

ida_idd.DBG_FLAG_EXITSHOTOK
    IDA may take a memory snapshot at PROCESS_EXITED event.

ida_idd.DBG_FLAG_FAKE_ATTACH
    PROCESS_ATTACHED is a fake event and does not suspend the execution 
            

ida_idd.DBG_FLAG_FAKE_MEMORY
    get_memory_info()/read_memory()/write_memory() work with the idb. (there is no real process to read from, as for the replayer module) the kernel will not call these functions if this flag is set. however, third party plugins may call them, they must be implemented. 
            

ida_idd.DBG_FLAG_FAST_STEP
    Do not refresh memory layout info after single stepping.

ida_idd.DBG_FLAG_FULL_INSTR_BPT
    Setting a breakpoint in the middle of an instruction will also break.

    Watchpoints are triggered before the offending instruction is executed. The debugger must temporarily disable the watchpoint and single-step before resuming. 
            

ida_idd.DBG_FLAG_LOWCNDS
    Low level breakpoint conditions are supported.

ida_idd.DBG_FLAG_MANMEMINFO
    If set, manual memory region manipulation commands will be available. Use this bit for debugger modules that cannot return memory layout information

ida_idd.DBG_FLAG_NEEDPORT
    Remote debugger requires port number (to be used with DBG_FLAG_NOHOST)

ida_idd.DBG_FLAG_NOHOST

ida_idd.DBG_FLAG_NOPARAMETERS
    Debugger module doesn't use commandline parameters.

ida_idd.DBG_FLAG_NOPASSWORD
    Remote debugger doesn't use password.

ida_idd.DBG_FLAG_NOSTARTDIR
    Debugger module doesn't use startup directory.

ida_idd.DBG_FLAG_PREFER_SWBPTS
    Prefer to use software breakpoints.

ida_idd.DBG_FLAG_REMOTE
    Remote debugger (requires remote host name unless DBG_FLAG_NOHOST)

ida_idd.DBG_FLAG_SAFE
    The debugger is safe (probably because it just emulates the application without really running it) 
            

ida_idd.DBG_FLAG_SMALLBLKS
    If set, IDA uses 256-byte blocks for caching memory contents. Otherwise, 1024-byte blocks are used

ida_idd.debapp_attrs_t

ida_idd.debapp_attrs_t.__init__(self)

ida_idd.debapp_attrs_t.addrsize
    address size of the process. Since 64-bit debuggers usually can debug 32-bit applications, we cannot rely on sizeof(ea_t) to detect the current address size.

ida_idd.debugger_t.ev_cleanup_appcall
    Cleanup after appcall(). The debugger module must keep the stack blob in the memory until this event is generated. It will be generated by the kernel for each successful appcall(). There is an exception: if APPCALL_MANUAL, IDA may not call cleanup_appcall. If the user selects to terminate a manual appcall, then cleanup_appcall will be generated. Otherwise, the debugger module should terminate the appcall when the generated event returns. This event is generated in debthread. Available if HAS_APPCALL is set 
              

ida_idd.debugger_t.ev_dbg_enable_trace
    Enable/Disable tracing. The kernel will generated this event if the debugger plugin set DBG_FLAG_TRACER_MODULE. TRACE_FLAGS can be a set of STEP_TRACE, INSN_TRACE, BBLK_TRACE or FUNC_TRACE. This event is generated in the main thread. 
              

ida_idd.debugger_t.ev_detach_process
    Detach from the debugged process. May be generated while the process is running or suspended. Must detach from the process in any case.

ida_idd.debugger_t.ev_eval_lowcnd
    Evaluate a low level breakpoint condition at 'ea'. Other evaluation errors are displayed in a dialog box. This call is used by IDA when the process has already been temporarily suspended for some reason and IDA has to decide whether the process should be resumed or definitely suspended because of a breakpoint with a low level condition. This event is generated in debthread. 
              

ida_idd.debugger_t.ev_exit_process
    Stop the process. May be generated while the process is running or suspended. Must terminate the process in any case.

    Retrieve process- and debugger-specific runtime attributes. This event is generated in the main thread. 
              

ida_idd.debugger_t.ev_get_debmod_extensions
    Get pointer to debugger specific events. This event returns a pointer to a structure that holds pointers to debugger module specific events. For information on the structure layout, please check the corresponding debugger module. Most debugger modules return nullptr because they do not have any extensions. Available extensions may be generated from plugins. This event is generated in the main thread. 
              

ida_idd.debugger_t.ev_get_debug_event
    Get a pending debug event and suspend the process. This event will be generated regularly by IDA. This event is generated in debthread. IMPORTANT: the BREAKPOINT/EXCEPTION/STEP events must be reported only after reporting other pending events for a thread. Must be implemented.

It is useful in certain cases like the iOS debugger, which is a remote debugger but the remote debugserver does not provide dwarf info. So, we allow the debugger client to decide where to look for debug info locally. 
              

ida_idd.debugger_t.ev_init_debugger
    Initialize debugger. This event is generated in the main thread. 
              

ida_idd.debugger_t.ev_is_tracing_enabled
    Is tracing enabled? The kernel will generated this event if the debugger plugin set DBG_FLAG_TRACER_MODULE. TRACE_BIT can be one of the following: STEP_TRACE, INSN_TRACE, BBLK_TRACE or FUNC_TRACE 
              

ida_idd.debugger_t.ev_map_address
    Map process address. The debugger module may ignore this event. This event is generated in debthread. IDA will generate this event only if DBG_HAS_MAP_ADDRESS is set.

ida_idd.debugger_t.ev_request_pause
    Prepare to pause the process. Normally the next get_debug_event() will pause the process If the process is sleeping, then the pause will not occur until the process wakes up. If the debugger module does not react to this event, then it will be impossible to pause the program. This event is generated in debthread. Available if DBG_HAS_REQUEST_PAUSE is set 
              

ida_idd.debugger_t.ev_resume
    Continue after handling the event. This event is generated in debthread. Must be implemented. 
              

ida_idd.debugger_t.ev_rexec
    Execute a command on the remote computer. Available if DBG_HAS_REXEC is set

ida_idd.debugger_t.ev_set_resume_mode
    Specify resume action Available if DBG_HAS_SET_RESUME_MODE is set 
              

ida_idd.debugger_t.ev_start_process
    Start an executable to debug. This event is generated in debthread. Must be implemented. 
              

ida_idd.debugger_t.ev_suspended
    This event will be generated by the kernel each time it has suspended the debuggee process and refreshed the database. The debugger module may add information to the database if necessary.
    The reason for introducing this event is that when an event like LOAD_DLL happens, the database does not reflect the memory state yet and therefore we can't add information about the dll into the database in the get_debug_event() function. Only when the kernel has adjusted the database we can do it. Example: for loaded PE DLLs we can add the exported function names to the list of debug names (see set_debug_names()).
    This event is generated in the main thread. 
              

ida_idd.debugger_t.ev_term_debugger

ida_idd.debugger_t.ev_thread_suspend
    Suspend a running thread Available if DBG_HAS_THREAD_SUSPEND is set 
              

ida_idd.debugger_t.ev_update_bpts
    Add/del breakpoints. bpts array contains nadd bpts to add, followed by ndel bpts to del. This event is generated in debthread. 
              

ida_idd.debugger_t.ev_update_call_stack
    Calculate the call stack trace for the given thread. This event is generated when the process is suspended and should fill the 'trace' object with the information about the current call stack. If this event returns DRC_NONE, IDA will try to invoke a processor-specific mechanism (see processor_t::ev_update_call_stack). If the current processor module does not implement stack tracing, then IDA will fall back to a generic algorithm (based on the frame pointer chain) to calculate the trace. This event is ideal if the debugging targets manage stack frames in a peculiar way, requiring special analysis. This event is generated in the main thread. Available if DBG_HAS_UPDATE_CALL_STACK is set 
              

ida_idd.debugger_t.ev_update_lowcnds
    Update low-level (server side) breakpoint conditions. This event is generated in debthread.

ida_idp
    Contains definition of the interface to IDP modules.
    
    The interface consists of two structures:
    * definition of target assembler: ::ash
    * definition of current processor: ::ph
    
    
    These structures contain information about target processor and assembler features.
    It also defines two groups of kernel events:
    * processor_t::event_t processor related events
    * idb_event:event_code_t database related events
    
    
    The processor related events are used to communicate with the processor module. The database related events are used to inform any interested parties, like plugins or processor modules, about the changes in the database.

    (Lumina) calcrel info has bits granularity, not bytes - construction flag only

ida_idp.PR2_USE_CALCREL
    (Lumina) the module supports calcrel info

ida_idp.PRN_BIN
    binary

ida_idp.PRN_DEC
    decimal

ida_idp.PRN_HEX
    hex

ida_idp.PRN_OCT
    octal

ida_idp.PR_ADJSEGS
    IDA may adjust segments' starting/ending addresses.

ida_idp.PR_ALIGN
    All data items should be aligned properly.

ida_idp.PR_ALIGN_INSN
    allow ida to create alignment instructions arbitrarily. Since these instructions might lead to other wrong instructions and spoil the listing, IDA does not create them by default anymore 
            

ida_idp.PR_ASSEMBLE
    Module has a built-in assembler and will react to ev_assemble.

ida_idp.PR_BINMEM
    the processor module provides correct segmentation for binary files (i.e. it creates additional segments). The kernel will not ask the user to specify the RAM/ROM sizes 
            

ida_idp.PR_CHK_XREF
    don't allow near xrefs between segments with different bases

ida_idp.PR_CNDINSNS
    has conditional instructions

ida_idp.PR_DEFNUM
    mask - default number representation

ida_idp.PR_DEFSEG32
    segments are 32-bit by default

ida_idp.PR_DEFSEG64
    segments are 64-bit by default

ida_idp.PR_DELAYED
    has delayed jumps and calls. If this flag is set, processor_t::is_basic_block_end, processor_t::delay_slot_insn should be implemented 
            

ida_idp.PR_NOCHANGE
    The user can't change segments and code/data attributes (display only) 
            

ida_idp.PR_NO_SEGMOVE
    the processor module doesn't support move_segm() (i.e. the user can't move segments) 
            

ida_idp.PR_OUTER
    has outer operands (currently only mc68k)

ida_idp.PR_PURGING
    there are calling conventions which may purge bytes from the stack

ida_idp.PR_RNAMESOK
    allow user register names for location names

ida_idp.PR_SCALE_STKVARS
    use processor_t::get_stkvar_scale callback

ida_idp.PR_SEGS
    has segment registers?

ida_idp.PR_SEGTRANS
    the processor module supports the segment translation feature (meaning it calculates the code addresses using the map_code_ea() function) 
            

ida_idp.PR_SGROTHER
    the segment registers don't contain the segment selectors.

ida_idp.PR_STACK_UP
    the stack grows up

ida_idp.PR_TYPEINFO
    the processor module fully supports type information callbacks; without full support, function argument locations and other things will probably be wrong. 
            

ida_idp.PR_USE32
    supports 32-bit addressing?

ida_idp.PR_USE64
    supports 64-bit addressing?

ida_idp.PR_USE_ARG_TYPES
    use processor_t::use_arg_types callback

ida_idp.PR_USE_TBYTE
    BTMT_SPECFLT means _TBYTE type

ida_idp.PR_WORD_INS
    instruction codes are grouped 2bytes in binary line prefix

ida_idp.REG_SPOIL
    processor_t::use_regarg_type uses this bit in the return value to indicate that the register value has been spoiled 
            

ida_idp.SETPROC_IDB
    set processor type for old idb

ida_idp.SETPROC_LOADER
    set processor type for new idb; if the user has specified a compatible processor, return success without changing it. if failure, call loader_failure() 
              

ida_idp.SETPROC_LOADER_NON_FATAL
    the same as SETPROC_LOADER but non-fatal failures.

ida_idp.SETPROC_USER
    set user-specified processor used for -p and manual processor change at later time

ida_kernwin.MFF_FAST
    Execute code as soon as possible. this mode is ok for calling ui related functions that do not query the database. 
            

ida_kernwin.MFF_NOWAIT
    Do not wait for the request to be executed. the caller should ensure that the request is not destroyed until the execution completes. if not, the request will be ignored. the request must be created using the 'new' operator to use it with this flag. it can be used in cancel_exec_request(). This flag can be used to delay the code execution until the next UI loop run even from the main thread.

    @param ud: pointer to user-defined context data. Is supplied by linearray_t
    @param x: number to map
    @param lnnum: line number to initialize 'lnnum'
    @returns a freshly allocated object. See also PCF_MAKEPLACE_ALLOCATES

ida_kernwin.place_t.name(self) -> str

ida_kernwin.read_range_selection(v: "TWidget *") -> "ea_t *, ea_t *"
    Get the address range for the selected range boundaries, this is the convenient function for read_selection() 
            
    @param v: view, nullptr means the last active window containing addresses
    @retval 0: no range is selected
    @retval 1: ok, start ea and end ea are filled

ida_kernwin.read_selection(v, p1, p2)
    Read the user selection, and store its information in p1 (from) and p2 (to).
    
    This can be used as follows:
    
    
    >>> p1 = ida_kernwin.twinpos_t()
    p2 = ida_kernwin.twinpos_t()
    view = ida_kernwin.get_current_viewer()
    ida_kernwin.read_selection(view, p1, p2)
    
    
    At that point, p1 and p2 hold information for the selection.
    But, the 'at' property of p1 and p2 is not properly typed.
    To specialize it, call #place() on it, passing it the view
    they were retrieved from. Like so:
    
    
    >>> place0 = p1.place(view)
    place1 = p2.place(view)
    
    
    This will effectively "cast" the place into a specialized type,
    holding proper information, depending on the view type (e.g.,
    disassembly, structures, enums, ...)
    
    @param v: The view to retrieve the selection for.
    @param p1: Storage for the "from" part of the selection.
    @param p2: Storage for the "to" part of the selection.
    @return: a bool value indicating success.

ida_kernwin.refresh_chooser(title: str) -> bool
    Mark a non-modal custom chooser for a refresh (ui_refresh_chooser).

ida_kernwin.refresh_custom_viewer(custom_viewer: "TWidget *") -> None
    Refresh custom ida viewer (ui_refresh_custom_viewer)

ida_kernwin.refresh_idaview() -> None

ida_kernwin.refresh_idaview_anyway() -> None
    Refresh all disassembly views (ui_refresh), forces an immediate refresh. Please consider request_refresh() instead 
            

ida_kernwin.refresh_navband(force: bool) -> None
    Refresh navigation band if changed (ui_refresh_navband). 
            
    @param force: refresh regardless

ida_kernwin.register_action(desc: "action_desc_t") -> bool
    Create a new action (ui_register_action). After an action has been created, it is possible to attach it to menu items (attach_action_to_menu()), or to popup menus (attach_action_to_popup()).
    Because the actions will need to call the handler's activate() and update() methods at any time, you shouldn't build your action handler on the stack.
    Please see the SDK's "ht_view" plugin for an example how to register actions. 
            
    @param desc: action to register
    @returns success

ida_kernwin.register_addon(info: "addon_info_t") -> int
    Register an add-on. Show its info in the About box. For plugins, should be called from init() function (repeated calls with the same product code overwrite previous entries) returns: index of the add-on in the list, or -1 on error 
            

ida_kernwin.register_and_attach_to_menu(menupath: str, name: str, label: str, shortcut: str, flags: int, handler: "action_handler_t *", owner: "void *", action_desc_t_flags: int) -> bool
    Helper.
    You are not encouraged to use this, as it mixes flags for both register_action(), and attach_action_to_menu().
    The only reason for its existence is to make it simpler to port existing plugins to the new actions API. 
            

ida_kernwin.register_timer(interval, callback)
    Register a timer
    
    @param interval: Interval in milliseconds
    @param callback: A Python callable that takes no parameters and returns an integer.
                     The callback may return:
                     -1   : to unregister the timer
                     >= 0 : the new or same timer interval
    @return: None or a timer object

    @param flags: combination of HIF_... bits (see set_highlight flags)
    @returns false if an error occurred

ida_kernwin.set_nav_colorizer(callback)
    Set a new colorizer for the navigation band.
    
    The 'callback' is a function of 2 arguments:
       - ea (the EA to colorize for)
       - nbytes (the number of bytes at that EA)
    and must return a 'long' value.
    
    The previous colorizer is returned, allowing
    the new 'callback' to use 'call_nav_colorizer'
    with it.
    
    Note that the previous colorizer is returned
    only the first time set_nav_colorizer() is called:
    due to the way the colorizers API is defined in C,
    it is impossible to chain more than 2 colorizers
    in IDAPython: the original, IDA-provided colorizer,
    and a user-provided one.
    
    Example: colorizer inverting the color provided by the IDA colorizer:
        def my_colorizer(ea, nbytes):
            global ida_colorizer
            orig = ida_kernwin.call_nav_colorizer(ida_colorizer, ea, nbytes)
            return long(~orig)
    
        ida_colorizer = ida_kernwin.set_nav_colorizer(my_colorizer)
    
    @param callback: the new colorizer

ida_kernwin.set_view_renderer_type(v: "TWidget *", rt: "tcc_renderer_type_t") -> None
    Set the type of renderer to use in a view (ui_set_renderer_type)

ida_kernwin.show_wait_box(message: str) -> None
    Display a dialog box with "Please wait...". The behavior of the dialog box can be configured with well-known 
    tokens, that should be placed at the start of the format string: 
     "NODELAY\n": the dialog will show immediately, instead of 
     appearing after usual grace threshold 
     "HIDECANCEL\n": the cancel button won't be added to the dialog box 
     and user_cancelled() will always return false (but 
     can be called to refresh UI) 
     Using "HIDECANCEL" implies "NODELAY" 
    Plugins must call hide_wait_box() to close the dialog box, otherwise 
    the user interface will remain disabled. 
     Note that, if the wait dialog is already visible, show_wait_box() will 
     1) push the currently-displayed text on a stack 
     2) display the new text 
    Then, when hide_wait_box() is called, if that stack isn't empty its top 
    label will be popped and restored in the wait dialog. 
    This implies that a plugin should call hide_wait_box() exactly as many 
    times as it called show_wait_box(), or the wait dialog might remain 
    visible and block the UI. 
    Also, in case the plugin knows the wait dialog is currently displayed, 
    alternatively it can call replace_wait_box(), to replace the text of the
    dialog without pushing the currently-displayed text on the stack.

    Each address in the program has a corresponding netnode: netnode(ea).
    If we have no information about an address, the corresponding netnode is not created. Otherwise we will create a netnode and save information in it. All variable length information (names, comments, offset information, etc) is stored in the netnode.
    Don't forget that some information is already stored in the flags (bytes.hpp)

ida_nalt.SWI_DEFRET
    return in the default case (defjump==BADADDR)

ida_nalt.SWI_DEF_IN_TBL
    default case is an entry in the jump table. This flag is applicable in 2 cases:
    * The sparse indirect switch (i.e. a switch with a values table) {jump table size} == {value table size} + 1. The default case entry is the last one in the table (or the first one in the case of an inversed jump table).
    * The switch with insns in the jump table. The default case entry is before the first entry of the table. 
     See also the find_defjump_from_table() helper function. 
    
    
            

ida_nalt.SWI_ELBASE
    elbase is present (otherwise the base of the switch segment will be used)

ida_nalt.SWI_J32
    32-bit jump offsets

ida_nalt.SWI_JMPINSN
    jump table entries are insns. For such entries SHIFT has a different meaning. It denotes the number of insns in the entry. For example, 0 - the entry contains the jump to the case, 1 - the entry contains one insn like a 'mov' and jump to the end of case, and so on. 
            

ida_nalt.SWI_JMP_INV
    jumptable is inversed. (last entry is for first entry in values table) 
            

ida_nalt.SWI_JSIZE
    jump offset expansion bit

ida_nalt.SWI_SELFREL

ida_nalt.SWI_SPARSE
    sparse switch (value table present), otherwise lowcase present 
            

ida_nalt.SWI_STDTBL
    custom jump table with standard table formatting. ATM IDA doesn't use SWI_CUSTOM for switches with standard table formatting. So this flag can be considered as obsolete. 
            

ida_nalt.SWI_SUBTRACT
    table values are subtracted from the elbase instead of being added

ida_nalt.SWI_USER
    user specified switch (starting from version 2)

ida_netnode
    Functions that provide the lowest level public interface to the database. Namely, we use Btree. To learn more about BTree:
    
    [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree)
    We do not use Btree directly. Instead, we have another layer built on the top of Btree. Here is a brief explanation of this layer.
    An object called "netnode" is modeled on the top of Btree. Each netnode has a unique id: a 32-bit value (64-bit for ida64). Initially there is a trivial mapping of the linear addresses used in the program to netnodes (later this mapping may be modified using ea2node and node2ea functions; this is used for fast database rebasings). If we have additional information about an address (for example, a comment is attached to it), this information is stored in the corresponding netnode. See nalt.hpp to see how the kernel uses netnodes. Also, some netnodes have no corresponding linear address (however, they still have an id). They are used to store information not related to a particular address.
    Each netnode _may_ have the following attributes:
    
    * a name: an arbitrary non-empty string, up to 255KB-1 bytes
    * a value: arbitrary sized object, max size is MAXSPECSIZE
    * altvals: a sparse array of 32-bit values. indexes in this array may be 8-bit or 32-bit values
    * supvals: an array of arbitrary sized objects. (size of each object is limited by MAXSPECSIZE) indexes in this array may be 8-bit or 32-bit values
    * charvals: a sparse array of 8-bit values. indexes in this array may be 8-bit or 32-bit values
    * hashvals: a hash (an associative array). indexes in this array are strings values are arbitrary sized (max size is MAXSPECSIZE)
    
    
    Initially a new netnode contains no information at all so no disk space is used for it. As you add new information, the netnode grows.
    All arrays that are attached to the netnode behave in the same manner. Initially:
    * all members of altvals/charvals array are zeroes
    * all members of supvals/hashvals array are undefined
    
    
    If you need to store objects bigger that MAXSPECSIZE, please note that there are high-level functions to store arbitrary sized objects in supvals. See setblob/getblob and other blob-related functions.
    You may use netnodes to store additional information about the program. Limitations on the use of netnodes are the following:
    
    * use netnodes only if you could not find a kernel service to store your type of information
    * do not create netnodes with valid identifier names. Use the "$ " prefix (or any other prefix with characters not allowed in the identifiers for the names of your netnodes. Although you will probably not destroy anything by accident, using already defined names for the names of your netnodes is still discouraged.
    * you may create as many netnodes as you want (creation of an unnamed netnode does not increase the size of the database). however, since each netnode has a number, creating too many netnodes could lead to the exhaustion of the netnode numbers (the numbering starts at 0xFF000000)
    * remember that netnodes are automatically saved to the disk by the kernel.
    
    
    Advanced info:
    In fact a netnode may contain up to 256 arrays of arbitrary sized objects (not only the 4 listed above). Each array has an 8-bit tag. Usually tags are represented by character constants. For example, altvals and supvals are simply 2 of 256 arrays, with the tags 'A' and 'S' respectively.

ida_offset
    Functions that deal with offsets.
    
    "Being an offset" is a characteristic of an operand. This means that operand or its part represent offset from some address in the program. This linear address is called "offset base". Some operands may have 2 offsets simultaneously. Generally, IDA doesn't handle this except for Motorola outer offsets. Thus there may be two offset values in an operand: simple offset and outer offset.
    Outer offsets are handled by specifying special operand number: it should be ORed with OPND_OUTER value.
    See bytes.hpp for further explanation of operand numbers. 
        

ida_offset.add_refinfo_dref(insn: "insn_t const &", _from: ida_idaapi.ea_t, ri: "refinfo_t", opval: "adiff_t", type: "dref_t", opoff: int) -> ida_idaapi.ea_t
    Add xrefs for a reference from the given instruction ( insn_t::ea). This function creates a cross references to the target and the base. insn_t::add_off_drefs() calls this function to create xrefs for 'offset' operand. 
            
    @param insn: the referencing instruction
    @param ri: reference info block from the database
    @param opval: operand value (usually op_t::value or op_t::addr)
    @param type: type of xref
    @param opoff: offset of the operand from the start of instruction
    @returns the target address of the reference

ida_offset.calc_basevalue(target: ida_idaapi.ea_t, base: ida_idaapi.ea_t) -> ida_idaapi.ea_t
    Calculate the value of the reference base.

ida_offset.calc_offset_base(ea: ida_idaapi.ea_t, n: int) -> ida_idaapi.ea_t
    Try to calculate the offset base This function takes into account the fixup information, current ds and cs values. 
            
    @param ea: the referencing instruction/data address
    @param n: operand number
    * 0: first operand
    * 1: second operand
    * ...

    @returns output base address or BADADDR

ida_offset.calc_probable_base_by_value(ea: ida_idaapi.ea_t, off: int) -> ida_idaapi.ea_t
    Try to calculate the offset base. 2 bases are checked: current ds and cs. If fails, return BADADDR 
            

ida_offset.calc_reference_data(target: "ea_t *", base: "ea_t *", _from: ida_idaapi.ea_t, ri: "refinfo_t", opval: "adiff_t") -> bool
    Calculate the target and base addresses of an offset expression. The calculated target and base addresses are returned in the locations pointed by 'base' and 'target'. In case 'ri.base' is BADADDR, the function calculates the offset base address from the referencing instruction/data address. The target address is copied from ri.target. If ri.target is BADADDR then the target is calculated using the base address and 'opval'. This function also checks if 'opval' matches the full value of the reference and takes in account the memory-mapping. 
            
    @param target: output target address
    @param base: output base address
    @param ri: reference info block from the database
    @param opval: operand value (usually op_t::value or op_t::addr)
    @returns success

ida_offset.calc_target(*args) -> ida_idaapi.ea_t

        1. calc_target(from: ida_idaapi.ea_t, ea: ida_idaapi.ea_t, n: int, opval: adiff_t) -> ida_idaapi.ea_t
    
    # 0: calc_target(from: ida_idaapi.ea_t, opval: adiff_t, ri: const refinfo_t &) -> ida_idaapi.ea_t
    
    Calculate the target using the provided refinfo_t.
    
    
    # 1: calc_target(from: ida_idaapi.ea_t, ea: ida_idaapi.ea_t, n: int, opval: adiff_t) -> ida_idaapi.ea_t

    See get_offset_expression()

ida_offset.get_offset_expression(ea: ida_idaapi.ea_t, n: int, _from: ida_idaapi.ea_t, offset: "adiff_t", getn_flags: int = 0) -> str
    Get offset expression (in the form "offset name+displ"). This function uses offset translation function ( processor_t::translate) if your IDP module has such a function. Translation function is used to map linear addresses in the program (only for offsets).
    Example: suppose we have instruction at linear address 0x00011000: `mov     ax, [bx+7422h] ` and at ds:7422h: `array   dw      ... ` We want to represent the second operand with an offset expression, so then we call: `get_offset_expresion(0x001100, 1, 0x001102, 0x7422, buf);
                         |         |  |         |       |
                         |         |  |         |       +output buffer
                         |         |  |         +value of offset expression
                         |         |  +address offset value in the instruction
                         |         +the second operand
                         +address of instruction` and the function will return a colored string: `offset array ` 
            
    @param ea: start of instruction or data with the offset expression
    @param n: operand number (may be ORed with OPND_OUTER)
    * 0: first operand
    * 1: second operand
    * ...
    * 7: eighth operand
    @param offset: value of operand or its part. The function will return text representation of this value as offset expression.
    @param getn_flags: combination of:
    * GETN_APPZERO: meaningful only if the name refers to a structure. appends the struct field name if the field offset is zero
    * GETN_NODUMMY: do not generate dummy names for the expression but pretend they already exist (useful to verify that the offset expression can be represented)
    @retval 0: can't convert to offset expression
    @retval 1: ok, a simple offset expression
    @retval 2: ok, a complex offset expression

    @param ea: linear address. if 'ea' has unexplored bytes, try to convert them to
    * no segment: fail
    * 16bit segment: to 16bit word data
    * 32bit segment: to dword
    @param n: operand number (may be ORed with OPND_OUTER)
    * 0: first
    * 1: second
    * ...
    * 7: eighth operand
    
    
    * OPND_MASK: all operands
    @param ri: reference information
    @returns success

ida_pro._qstrvec_t
    WARNING: It is very unlikely an IDAPython user should ever, ever
    have to use this type. It should only be used for IDAPython internals.
    
    For example, in py_askusingform.py, we ctypes-expose to the IDA
    kernel & UI a qstrvec instance, in case a DropdownListControl is
    constructed.
    That's because that's what ask_form expects, and we have no
    choice but to make a DropdownListControl hold a qstrvec_t.
    This is, afaict, the only situation where a Python
    _qstrvec_t is required.

ida_problems
    Functions that deal with the list of problems.
    
    There are several problem lists. An address may be inserted to any list. The kernel simply maintains these lists, no additional processing is done.
    The problem lists are accessible for the user from the View->Subviews->Problems menu item.
    Addresses in the lists are kept sorted. In general IDA just maintains these lists without using them during analysis (except PR_ROLLED). 
        

ida_problems.PR_ATTN
    Attention! Probably erroneous situation.

ida_problems.PR_BADSTACK
    Failed to trace the value of the stack pointer.

ida_problems.PR_COLLISION
    FLAIR collision: the function with the given name already exists.

    FLAIR match indecision: the patterns matched, but not the function(s) being referenced.

ida_problems.PR_DISASM
    Can't disasm.

ida_problems.PR_JUMP
    Jump by table !!!! ignored.

ida_range
    Contains the definition of range_t.
    
    A range is a non-empty continuous range of addresses (specified by its start and end addresses, the end address is excluded from the range).
    Ranges are stored in the Btree part of the IDA database. To learn more about Btrees (Balanced Trees): [http://www.bluerwhite.org/btree/](http://www.bluerwhite.org/btree/)

ida_segment
    Functions that deal with segments.
    
    IDA requires that all program addresses belong to segments (each address must belong to exactly one segment). The situation when an address doesn't belong to any segment is allowed as a temporary situation only when the user changes program segmentation. Bytes outside a segment can't be converted to instructions, have names, comments, etc. Each segment has its start address, ending address and represents a contiguous range of addresses. There might be unused holes between segments.
    Each segment has its unique segment selector. This selector is used to distinguish the segment from other segments. For 16-bit programs the selector is equal to the segment base paragraph. For 32-bit programs there is special array to translate the selectors to the segment base paragraphs. A selector is a 32/64 bit value.
    The segment base paragraph determines the offsets in the segment. If the start address of the segment == (base << 4) then the first offset in the segment will be 0. The start address should be higher or equal to (base << 4). We will call the offsets in the segment 'virtual addresses'. So, the virtual address of the first byte of the segment is
    (start address of segment - segment base linear address)
    For IBM PC, the virtual address corresponds to the offset part of the address. For other processors (Z80, for example), virtual addresses correspond to Z80 addresses and linear addresses are used only internally. For MS Windows programs the segment base paragraph is 0 and therefore the segment virtual addresses are equal to linear addresses. 
        

ida_segment.ADDSEG_FILLGAP
    fill gap between new segment and previous one. i.e. if such a gap exists, and this gap is less than 64K, then fill the gap by extending the previous segment and adding .align directive to it. This way we avoid gaps between segments. too many gaps lead to a virtual array failure. it cannot hold more than ~1000 gaps. 
            

ida_segment.ADDSEG_IDBENC
    'name' and 'sclass' are given in the IDB encoding; non-ASCII bytes will be decoded accordingly

    Add a new segment, second form. Segment alignment is set to saRelByte. Segment combination is "public" or "stack" (if segment class is "STACK"). Addressing mode of segment is taken as default (16bit or 32bit). Default segment registers are set to BADSEL.

    @param flags: Move segment flags
    @returns Move segment result codes

ida_segment.move_segm_start(ea: ida_idaapi.ea_t, newstart: ida_idaapi.ea_t, mode: int) -> bool
    Move segment start. The main difference between this function and set_segm_start() is that this function may expand the previous segment while set_segm_start() never does it. So, this function allows to change bounds of two segments simultaneously. If the previous segment and the specified segment have the same addressing mode and segment base, then instructions and data are not destroyed - they simply move from one segment to another. Otherwise all instructions/data which migrate from one segment to another are destroyed. 
            
    @param ea: any address belonging to the segment
    @param newstart: new start address of the segment note that segment start address should be higher than segment base linear address.

    * 1: if it is necessary to destroy defined items, just destroy them without asking the user
    * -1: if it is necessary to destroy defined items, don't destroy them (i.e. function will fail)
    * -2: don't destroy defined items (function will succeed)
    @retval 1: ok
    @retval 0: failed, a warning message is displayed

    @param s: pointer to segment
    @param bitness: new addressing mode of segment
    * 2: 64bit segment
    * 1: 32bit segment

    Set segment class. 
            
    @param s: pointer to segment (may be nullptr)
    @param sclass: segment class (may be nullptr). If segment type is SEG_NORM and segment class is one of predefined names, then segment type is changed to:
    * "CODE" -> SEG_CODE
    * "DATA" -> SEG_DATA
    * "STACK" -> SEG_BSS
    * "BSS" -> SEG_BSS
    * if "UNK" then segment type is reset to SEG_NORM.

ida_segment.set_segm_name(s: "segment_t", name: str, flags: int = 0) -> int
    Rename segment. The new name is validated (see validate_name). A segment always has a name. If you hadn't specified a name, the kernel will assign it "seg###" name where ### is segment number. 
            
    @param s: pointer to segment (may be nullptr)
    @param name: new segment name
    @param flags: ADDSEG_IDBENC or 0

    @param ea: any address belonging to the segment
    @param newstart: new start address of the segment note that segment start address should be higher than segment base linear address.
    @param flags: Segment modification flags

    Set new translation list. 
            
    @param segstart: start address of the segment to add translation to
    @param transmap: vector of segment start addresses for the translation list. If transmap is empty, the translation list is deleted.
    @retval 1: ok
    @retval 0: too many translations or bad segstart

ida_segment.set_selector(selector: "sel_t", paragraph: ida_idaapi.ea_t) -> int

    @param selector: number of selector to map
    * if selector == BADSEL, then return 0 (fail)
    * if the selector has had a mapping, old mapping is destroyed
    * if the selector number is equal to paragraph value, then the mapping is destroyed because we don't need to keep trivial mappings.
    @param paragraph: paragraph to map selector
    @retval 1: ok
    @retval 0: failure (bad selector or too many mappings)

ida_segment.set_visible_segm(s: "segment_t", visible: bool) -> None
    See SFL_HIDDEN.

ida_segment.setup_selector(segbase: ida_idaapi.ea_t) -> "sel_t"
    Allocate a selector for a segment if necessary. You must call this function before calling add_segm_ex(). add_segm() calls this function itself, so you don't need to allocate a selector. This function will allocate a selector if 'segbase' requires more than 16 bits and the current processor is IBM PC. Otherwise it will return the segbase value. 
            
    @param segbase: a new segment base paragraph
    @returns the allocated selector number

ida_segment.std_out_segm_footer(ctx: "outctx_t &", seg: "segment_t") -> None

If the string list is not cleared using clear_strlist(), the list will be saved to the database and restored on the next startup.
    The users of this list should call build_strlist() if they need an up-to-date version.

ida_tryblks
    Architecture independent exception handling info.
    
    Try blocks have the following general properties:
    * A try block specifies a possibly fragmented guarded code region.
    * Each try block has always at least one catch/except block description
    * Each catch block contains its boundaries and a filter.
    * Additionally a catch block can hold sp adjustment and the offset to the exception object offset (C++).
    * Try blocks can be nested. Nesting is automatically calculated at the retrieval time.
    * There may be (nested) multiple try blocks starting at the same address.

    Type information in IDA.
    
    In IDA, types are represented by and manipulated through tinfo_t objects.
    A tinfo_t can represent a simple type (e.g., `int`, `float`), a complex type (a structure, enum, union, typedef), or even an array, or a function prototype.
    The key types in this file are:
    
    * til_t - a type info library. Holds type information in serialized form.
    * tinfo_t - information about a type (simple, complex, ...)
    
    
    # Glossary
    All throughout this file, there are certain terms that will keep appearing:
    
    * udt: "user-defined type": a structure or union - but not enums. See udt_type_data_t
    * udm: "udt member": i.e., a structure or union member. See udm_t
    * edm: "enum member": i.e., an enumeration member - i.e., an enumerator. See edm_t
    
    
    # Under the hood
    The tinfo_t type provides a lot of useful methods already, but it's possible to achieve even more by retrieving its contents into the container classes:
    
    * udt_type_data_t - for structures & unions. See tinfo_t::get_udt_details . Essentially, a vector of udm_t
    * enum_type_data_t - for enumerations. See tinfo_t::get_enum_details . Essentially, a vector of edm_t
    * ptr_type_data_t - for pointers. See tinfo_t::get_ptr_details
    * array_type_data_t - for arrays. See tinfo_t::get_array_details
    * func_type_data_t - for function prototypes. See tinfo_t::get_func_details
    * bitfield_type_data_t - for bitfields. See tinfo_t::get_bitfield_details
    
    
    # Attached & detached tinfo_t objects
    tinfo_t objects can be attached to a til_t library, or can be created without using any til_t.
    Here is an example, assigning a function prototype:
    func_type_data_t func_info;
    funcarg_t argc; argc.name = "argc"; argc.type = tinfo_t(BT_INT); func_info.push_back(argc);
    funcarg_t argv; argc.name = "argv"; argc.type = tinfo_t("const char **"); func_info.push_back(argv)
    tinfo_t tif; if ( tif.create_func(func_info) ) { ea_t ea = // get address of "main" apply_tinfo(ea, tif, TINFO_DEFINITE); }
    This code manipulates a "detached" tinfo_t object, which does not depend on any til_t file. However, any complex type will require a til_t file. In IDA, there is always a default til_t file for each idb file. This til_t file can be specified by nullptr.
    On the other hand, the following code manipulates an "attached" tinfo_t object, and any operation that modifies it, will also modify it in the hosting til_t:
    tinfo_t tif; Load type from the "Local Types" til_t. Note: we could have used `get_idati()` instead of nullptr if ( tif.get_named_type(nullptr, "my_struct_t") ) tif.add_udm("extra_field", "unsigned long long");
    You can check if a tinfo_t instance is attached to a type in a til_t file by calling tinfo_t::is_typeref

ida_typeinf.apply_once_tinfo_and_name(dea: ida_idaapi.ea_t, tif: "tinfo_t", name: str) -> bool
    Apply the specified type and name to the address. This function checks if the address already has a type. If the old type 
    does not exist or the new type is 'better' than the old type, then the 
    new type will be applied. A type is considered better if it has more 
    information (e.g. BTMT_STRUCT is better than BT_INT). 
    The same logic is with the name: if the address already have a meaningful 
    name, it will be preserved. Only if the old name does not exist or it 
    is a dummy name like byte_123, it will be replaced by the new name.

    Lower type. Inspect the type and lower all function subtypes using lower_func_type(). 
    We call the prototypes usually encountered in source files "high level" 
    They may have implicit arguments, array arguments, big structure retvals, etc 
    We introduce explicit arguments (i.e. 'this' pointer) and call the result 
    "low level prototype". See FTI_HIGH.
    In order to improve heuristics for recognition of big structure retvals, 
    it is recommended to pass a helper that will be used to make decisions. 
    That helper will be used only for lowering 'tif', and not for the children 
    types walked through by recursion.

    * ordinal: int
    * name: str
    * tid: int
    * til: til_t=None # `None` means `get_idati()`

    In the 2nd form, the 'type' descriptor, can be one of:
    
    * type_t: if the type is simple (integral/floating/bool). E.g., `BTF_INT`
    * tinfo_t: can handle more complex types (structures, pointers, arrays, ...)
    * str: a C type declaration
    
    If an input argument is incorrect, the constructor may raise an exception

    Set structure packing. The value controls how little a structure member alignment can be. Example: if pack=1, then it is possible to align a double to a byte. __attribute__((aligned(1))) double x; However, if pack=3, a double will be aligned to 8 (2**3) even if requested to be aligned to a byte. pack==0 will have the same effect. The type editing functions (they accept etf_flags) may overwrite this attribute.

ida_ua
    Functions that deal with the disassembling of program instructions.
    
    There are 2 kinds of functions:
    * functions that are called from the kernel to disassemble an instruction. These functions call IDP module for it.
    * functions that are called from IDP module to disassemble an instruction. We will call them 'helper functions'.
    
    
    Disassembly of an instruction is made in three steps:
    0. analysis: ana.cpp
    1. emulation: emu.cpp
    2. conversion to text: out.cpp
    
    
    The kernel calls the IDP module to perform these steps. At first, the kernel always calls the analysis. The analyzer must decode the instruction and fill the insn_t instance that it receives through its callback. It must not change anything in the database.
    The second step, the emulation, is called for each instruction. This step must make necessary changes to the database, plan analysis of subsequent instructions, track register values, memory contents, etc. Please keep in mind that the kernel may call the emulation step for any address in the program - there is no ordering of addresses. Usually, the emulation is called for consecutive addresses but this is not guaranteed.
    The last step, conversion to text, is called each time an instruction is displayed on the screen. The kernel will always call the analysis step before calling the text conversion step. The emulation and the text conversion steps should use the information stored in the insn_t instance they receive. They should not access the bytes of the instruction and decode it again - this should only be done in the analysis step.

    Try to extend the instruction.
    This function may modify 'insn' and return false; these changes will be accepted by the kernel but the instruction will not be considered as a macro.
    
    @param insn: Instruction to modify, usually the first instruction of the macro
    @param may_go_forward: Is it ok to consider the next instruction for the macro? This argument may be false, for example, if there is a cross reference to the end of INSN. In this case creating a macro is not desired. However, it may still be useful to perform minor tweaks to the instruction using the information about the surrounding instructions.
    @returns true if created an macro instruction.

ida_ua.macro_constructor_t.construct_macro(self, insn: "insn_t", enable: bool) -> bool
    Construct a macro instruction. This function may be called from ana() to generate a macro instruction.
    The real work is done by the 'build_macro()' virtual function. It must be defined by the processor module.
    construct_macro() modifies the database using the info provided by build_macro(). It verifies if the instruction can really be created (for example, that other items do not hinder), may plan to reanalyze the macro, etc. If the macro instructions are disabled by the user, construct_macro() will destroy the macro instruction. Note: if INSN_MODMAC is not set in insn.flags, the database will not be modified.
    
    @param insn: the instruction to modify into a macro
    @param enable: enable macro generation
    @retval true: the macro instruction is generated in 'insn'
    @retval false: did not create a macro

ida_ua.o_displ
    Memory Ref [Base Reg + Index Reg + Displacement].
    
    A memory reference using register contents with displacement. The displacement should be stored in the op_t::addr field. The rest of information is stored the same way as in o_phrase. 
            

ida_ua.o_far
    Immediate Far Address (CODE).
    
    If the current processor has a special addressing mode for inter-segment references, then this operand type should be used instead of o_near. If you want, you may use PR_CHK_XREF in processor_t::flag to disable inter-segment calls if o_near operand type is used. Currently only IBM PC uses this flag. 
            

ida_ua.o_idpspec0
    processor specific type.

ida_ua.o_idpspec1
    processor specific type.

ida_ua.o_idpspec2
    processor specific type.

ida_ua.o_idpspec3
    processor specific type.

ida_ua.o_idpspec4
    processor specific type.

ida_ua.o_idpspec5
    processor specific type. (there can be more processor specific types) 
            

ida_ua.o_imm
    Immediate Value.
    
    Any operand consisting of only a number is represented by this operand type. The value should be stored in op_t::value. You may sign extend short (1-2 byte) values. In any case don't forget to specify op_t::dtype (should be set for all operand types). 
            

ida_ua.o_mem
    Direct Memory Reference (DATA).
    
    A direct memory data reference whose target address is known at compilation time. The target virtual address is stored in op_t::addr and the full address is calculated as to_ea(  insn_t::cs, op_t::addr ). For the processors with complex memory organization the final address can be calculated using other segment registers. For flat memories, op_t::addr is the final address and insn_t::cs is usually equal to zero. In any case, the address within the segment should be stored in op_t::addr. 
            

ida_ua.o_near
    Immediate Near Address (CODE).
    
    A direct memory code reference whose target address is known at the compilation time. The target virtual address is stored in op_t::addr and the final address is always to_ea( insn_t::cs, op_t::addr). Usually this operand type is used for the branches and calls whose target address is known. If the current processor has 2 different types of references for inter-segment and intra-segment references, then this should be used only for intra-segment references.
    If the above operand types do not cover all possible addressing modes, then use o_idpspec... operand types. 
            

ida_ua.o_phrase
    Memory Ref [Base Reg + Index Reg].
    
    A memory reference using register contents. Indexed, register based, and other addressing modes can be represented with the operand type. This addressing mode cannot contain immediate values (use o_displ instead). The phrase number should be stored in op_t::phrase. To denote the pre-increment and similar features please use additional operand fields like op_t::specflag... Usually op_t::phrase contains the register number and additional information is stored in op_t::specflags... Please note that this operand type cannot contain immediate values (except the scaling coefficients). 
            

ida_ua.o_reg
    General Register (al,ax,es,ds...).
    
    The register number should be stored in op_t::reg. All processor registers, including special registers, can be represented by this operand type. 
            

ida_ua.o_void
    No Operand.

ida_ua.op_t.offb
    Offset of operand value from the instruction start (0 means unknown). Of course this field is meaningful only for certain types of operands. Leave it equal to zero if the operand has no offset. This offset should point to the 'interesting' part of operand. For example, it may point to the address of a function in `call func ` or it may point to bytes holding '5' in `mov  ax, [bx+5] ` Usually bytes pointed to this offset are relocated (have fixup information). 
            

ida_ua.op_t.offo
    Same as offb (some operands have 2 numeric values used to form an operand). This field is used for the second part of operand if it exists. Currently this field is used only for outer offsets of Motorola processors. Leave it equal to zero if the operand has no offset.

ida_ua.op_t.type
    Type of operand (see Operand types)

ida_ua.op_t.value
    operand value (o_imm) or outer displacement (o_displ+OF_OUTER_DISP). integer values should be in IDA's (little-endian) order. when using ieee_realcvt(), floating point values should be in the processor's native byte order. dt_double and dt_qword values take up 8 bytes (value and addr fields for 32-bit modules). NB: in case a dt_dword/dt_qword immediate is forced to float by user, the kernel converts it to processor's native order before calling FP conversion routines.

ida_mergemod
    Merge functionality for modules.
    
    NOTE: this functionality is available in IDA Teams (not IDA Pro)
    This file contains helper classes and convenience functions for module (plugin or processor module) merging.
    Each module is responsible for merging the data it owns (the module data). At the very beginning, the merging engine generates the ev_create_merge_handlers event. Modules should hook to this event to create merge handlers (mergers) that are responsible for the module data.
    We assume that each module may have:
    
    * its data structure, derived from plugmod_t or procmod_t. we call this structure moddata.
    * a dedicated netnode (module node), modnode for short.
    
    
    Moddata is registered with the IDA kernel using the set_module_data() function, which returns an integer, moddata_id. moddata_id is used to access the module data structure during merging, so it is mandatory for all modules that support merging.
    The following sources of mergeable data are supported:
    1. Data fields inside moddata 2. Values (scalar or binary, including blobs) stored in the module node 3. Values (scalar or binary, including blobs) stored in arbitrary netnodes 4. Data fields inside an auxiliary structure (provided by a special helper) 5. Indexed arrays of data stored in netnodes
    Usually the sources #1-4 are handled by a single merger, which can be parameterized using the folowing information:
    
    * moddata_id
    * module name
    * module node name
    * array of field descriptors (idbattr_info_t idpopts_info[], see ida.hpp)
    
    
    See plugins/mex1 for an example of such a merger.
    These parameters are stored in a helper class (moddata_diff_helper_t or derived). The helper class can override the following virtual methods:
    merge_starting - prepare module data for merging (e.g. load data from idb) merge_ending - opposite to merge_starting (e.g. save merged data to idb) get_struc_ptr - get pointer to the auxiliary structure (to handle source #4); this method will be called only if the fields with the IDI_HLPSTRUC bit are present in the idpopts_info[] array
    For most plugins, the default implementation of moddata_diff_helper_t or the std_moddata_diff_helper_t helper (presented below) is sufficient. You can find examples of non-standard helpers in plugins/mex2 and plugins/callgraph.
    The source #5 is handled by a different set of mergers described by an array of merge_node_info_t entries: a merger per entry. A non-trivial example can be found in plugins/mex3 and plugins/ex_merge_ldrdata.
    A module can use the create_std_modmerge_handlers() function to create necessary merge handlers. Please pay attention to the following arguments:
    helper - a helper class responsible for access to the internal module data for the sources #1-4. It can be used to prepare a pointer to the internal module structure and load/save data before/after merging (example: plugins/mex2). Im most cases the default helper class moddata_diff_helper_t can be used. merge_node_info - array of descriptions for the source #5. Note that the same module node is used for all array elements. If you need this kind of mergers for other netnodes, you should add them manually using the create_nodeval_merge_handler() function (example: plugins/mex3)
    See also module/mergecmn.cpp for procmod-specific functions and macros.
    Glossary:
    modmerger = module merger moddata = module data moddata_id = module data id 
        

ida_mergemod.create_std_modmerge_handlers(mhp: "merge_handler_params_t &", helper: "moddata_diff_helper_t &", merge_node_info: "merge_node_info2_t const *" = None) -> None
    convinience function to create merge handlers for modules/plugins

ida_merge
    Merge functionality.
    
    NOTE: this functionality is available in IDA Teams (not IDA Pro)
    There are 3 databases involved in merging: base_idb, local_db, and remote_idb.
    * base_idb: the common base ancestor of 'local_db' and 'remote_db'. in the UI this database is located in the middle.
    * local_idb: local database that will contain the result of the merging. in the UI this database is located on the left.
    * remote_idb: remote database that will merge into local_idb. It may reside locally on the current computer, despite its name. in the UI this database is located on the right. base_idb and remote_idb are opened for reading only. base_idb may be absent, in this case a 2-way merging is performed.
    
    
    Conflicts can be resolved automatically or interactively. The automatic resolving scores the conflicting blocks and takes the better one. The interactive resolving displays the full rendered contents side by side, and expects the user to select the better side for each conflict.
    Since IDB files contain various kinds of information, there are many merging phases. The entire list can be found in merge.cpp. Below are just some selected examples:
    * merge global database settings (inf and other global vars)
    * merge segmentation and changes to the database bytes
    * merge various lists: exports, imports, loaded tils, etc
    * merge names, functions, function frames
    * merge debugger settings, breakpoints
    * merge struct/enum views
    * merge local type libraries
    * merge the disassembly items (i.e. the segment contents) this includes operand types, code/data separation, etc
    * merge plugin specific info like decompiler types, dwarf mappings, etc
    
    
    To unify UI elements of each merge phase, we use merger views:
    * A view that consists of 2 or 3 panes: left (local_idb) and right (remote_idb). The common base is in the middle, if present.
    * Rendering of the panes depends on the phase, different phases show different contents.
    * The conflicts are highlighted by a colored background. Also, the detail pane can be consulted for additional info.
    * The user can select a conflict (or a bunch of conflicts) and say "use this block".
    * The user can browse the panes as he wishes. He will not be forced to handle conflicts in any particular order. However, once he finishes working with a merge handler and proceeds to the next one, he cannot go back.
    * Scrolling the left pane will synchronously scroll the right pane and vice versa.
    * There are the navigation commands like "go to the prev/next conflict"
    * The number of remaining conflicts to resolve is printed in the "Progress" chooser.
    * The user may manually modify local database inside the merger view. For that he may use the regular hotkeys. However, editing the database may lead to new conflicts, so we better restrict the available actions to some reasonable minimum. Currently, this is not implemented.
    
    
    IDA works in a new "merge" mode during merging. In this mode most events are not generated. We forbid them to reduce the risk that a rogue third-party plugin that is not aware of the "merge" mode would spoil something.
    For example, normally renaming a function causes a cascade of events and may lead to other database modifications. Some of them may be desired, some - not. Since there are some undesired events, it is better to stop generating them. However, some events are required to render the disassembly listing. For example, ev_ana_insn, av_out_insn. This is why some events are still generated in the "merge" mode.
    To let processor modules and plugins merge their data, we introduce a new event: ev_create_merge_handlers. It is generated immediately after opening all three idbs. The interested modules should react to this event by creating new merge handlers, if they need them.
    While the kernel can create arbitrary merge handlers, modules can create only the standard ones returned by:
    create_nodeval_merge_handler() create_nodeval_merge_handlers() create_std_modmerge_handlers()
    We do not document merge_handler_t because once a merge handler is created, it is used exclusively by the kernel.
    See mergemod.hpp for more information about the merge mode for modules.

ida_merge.merge_handler_params_t.ui_complex_details(self, *args) -> bool
    This function has the following signatures:
    
        0. ui_complex_details() -> bool
        1. ui_complex_details(_mh_flags: int) -> bool
    
    # 0: ui_complex_details() -> bool
    
    
    # 1: ui_complex_details(_mh_flags: int) -> bool
    
    Do not display the diffpos details in the chooser. For example, the MERGE_KIND_SCRIPTS handler puts the script body as the diffpos detail. It would not be great to show them as part of the chooser. 
            

ida_merge.merge_handler_params_t.ui_complex_name(self, *args) -> bool
    This function has the following signatures:
    
        0. ui_complex_name() -> bool
        1. ui_complex_name(_mh_flags: int) -> bool
    
    # 0: ui_complex_name() -> bool
    
    
    # 1: ui_complex_name(_mh_flags: int) -> bool
    
    It customary to create long diffpos names having many components that are separated by any 7-bit ASCII character (besides of '\0'). In this case it is possible to instruct IDA to use this separator to create a multi-column chooser. For example the MERGE_KIND_ENUMS handler has the following diffpos name: enum_1,enum_2 If MH_UI_COMMANAME is specified, IDA will create 2 columns for these names. 
            

ida_merge.merge_handler_params_t.ui_dp_shortname(self, *args) -> bool
    This function has the following signatures:
    
        0. ui_dp_shortname() -> bool
        1. ui_dp_shortname(_mh_flags: int) -> bool
    
    # 0: ui_dp_shortname() -> bool
    
    
    # 1: ui_dp_shortname(_mh_flags: int) -> bool
    
    The detail pane shows the diffpos details for the current diffpos range as a tree-like view. In this pane the diffpos names are used as tree node names and the diffpos details as their children. Sometimes, for complex diffpos names, the first part of the name looks better than the entire name. For example, the MERGE_KIND_SEGMENTS handler has the following diffpos name: <range>,<segm1>,<segm2>,<segm3> if MH_UI_DP_SHORTNAME is specified, IDA will use <range> as a tree node name 
            

ida_merge.merge_handler_params_t.ui_has_details(self, *args) -> bool
    This function has the following signatures:
    
        0. ui_has_details() -> bool
        1. ui_has_details(_mh_flags: int) -> bool
    
    # 0: ui_has_details() -> bool
    
    
    # 1: ui_has_details(_mh_flags: int) -> bool
    
    Should IDA display the diffpos detail pane?

ida_merge.merge_handler_params_t.ui_indent(self, *args) -> bool
    This function has the following signatures:
    
        0. ui_indent() -> bool
        1. ui_indent(_mh_flags: int) -> bool
    
    # 0: ui_indent() -> bool
    
    
    # 1: ui_indent(_mh_flags: int) -> bool
    
    In the ordinary situation the spaces from the both sides of diffpos name are trimmed. Use this UI hint to preserve the leading spaces. 
            

ida_merge.merge_handler_params_t.ui_linediff(self, *args) -> bool
    This function has the following signatures:
    
        0. ui_linediff() -> bool
        1. ui_linediff(_mh_flags: int) -> bool
    
    # 0: ui_linediff() -> bool
    
    
    # 1: ui_linediff(_mh_flags: int) -> bool
    
    In detail pane IDA shows difference between diffpos details. IDA marks added or deleted detail by color. In the modified detail the changes are marked. Use this UI hint if you do not want to show the differences inside detail. 
            

ida_merge.merge_handler_params_t.ui_split_char(self, *args) -> "char"
    This function has the following signatures:
    
        0. ui_split_char() -> char
        1. ui_split_char(_mh_flags: int) -> char
    
    # 0: ui_split_char() -> char
    
    
    # 1: ui_split_char(_mh_flags: int) -> char

ida_merge.merge_handler_params_t.ui_split_str(self, *args) -> str
    This function has the following signatures:
    
        0. ui_split_str() -> str
        1. ui_split_str(_mh_flags: int) -> str
    
    # 0: ui_split_str() -> str
    
    
    # 1: ui_split_str(_mh_flags: int) -> str
